## What it does

Chains together all the tools I use regularly into one pipeline with 10 phases:

| Phase | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Subdomain enumeration via subfinder, assetfinder, amass |
| 2 | Live host detection with httpx + optional screenshots via gowitness |
| 3 | Full port scan with nmap, flags anything that isn't 80/443 |
| 4 | URL crawling with katana, gau, and waybackurls — extracts parameter URLs |
| 5 | Prints 10 targeted Google dorks for the target |
| 6 | Nuclei scan across CVE, misconfiguration, exposed panels, SSRF, XSS, SQLi tags |
| 7 | XSS testing on parameter URLs via dalfox |
| 8 | SQL injection candidates filtered with gf, tested with sqlmap |
| 9 | Subdomain takeover check via nuclei takeover templates |
| 10 | Generates a markdown report summarizing everything |

All output lands in a folder named `results_TARGET_DATE/` so nothing gets mixed up between engagements.

## Requirements

Python 3.8+ and any of these tools you have installed (it skips the ones it can't find):

```
subfinder    assetfinder    amass
httpx        gowitness      nmap
katana       gau            waybackurls
nuclei       dalfox         sqlmap
gf
```

Install missing Go tools:
```bash
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/cmd/katana@latest
go install github.com/hahwul/dalfox/v2@latest
go install github.com/lc/gau/v2/cmd/gau@latest
go install github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls@latest
go install github.com/tomnomnom/gf@latest
```

Python dependency:
```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage

```bash
# Full pipeline (all 10 phases)
python3 bugbounty.py scan target.com

# Recon only — subdomains, live hosts, ports, URL crawl, dorks
python3 bugbounty.py recon target.com

# Vuln scanning only — needs existing recon output in the results folder
python3 bugbounty.py vuln target.com

# Just generate the report from an existing results folder
python3 bugbounty.py report target.com --out-dir results_target_com_2026-03-22

# Get Telegram notifications when each phase finishes
python3 bugbounty.py scan target.com --telegram --tg-token YOUR_TOKEN --tg-chat YOUR_CHAT_ID
```

The tool will ask you to confirm scope before running anything active. Pass `--skip-confirm` if you're running it in automation.

```

## Telegram notifications

Set up a bot via `@BotFather` on Telegram, grab your chat ID from `@userinfobot`, then pass them with `--telegram --tg-token ... --tg-chat ...`. You'll get a ping after recon, after vuln scanning, and when the report is ready — useful when you kick off a scan and walk away.

This tool is for authorized security testing only. Only run it against targets you have explicit permission to test. I'm not responsible for how you use it.
